## Code example
### Codewars task: 
- Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.
Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.
```
function lovefunc(flower1, flower2) {
  // Check if one flower has an odd number of petals and the other has an even number of petals
  if ((flower1 % 2 === 0 && flower2 % 2 !== 0) || (flower1 % 2 !== 0 && flower2 % 2 === 0)) {
    return true; // They are in love
  } else {
    return false; // They aren't in love
  }
}
