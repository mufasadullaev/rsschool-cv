## About Me
I am a graduate of WIUT (Westminster International University in Tashkent), where I completed my degree in Business Information Systems. During my studies, I gained a solid foundation in various programming languages and technologies.
I have a basic knowledge of C# and have worked with .NET framework and Windows Forms Applications (WFA). I have also explored PHP and have practical experience in object-oriented programming (OOP) through coursework and projects.

I am passionate about leveraging technology to create user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. I enjoy collaborating with a team and tackling challenging projects that allow me to apply my problem-solving skills and enhance my coding abilities.
With a strong foundation in programming concepts and a continuous desire to learn and grow, I am excited to contribute to innovative projects and further develop my career as a front-end developer.
